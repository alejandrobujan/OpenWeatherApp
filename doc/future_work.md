# Future Work

Most part of the possible future work is conditioned by the access to premium features in the API. Forecast, weather alerts or air pollution can be targets to complete the application.

Furthermore, as perviously mentioned, with a more dense app, the possibility of adding a preferences screen has to be considered, however, with the current features is difficult to make it fit in the app.

Another good point to consider, is to implement a user account system in a database server to allow users to login from every different phone and be able to access their favourites list.
